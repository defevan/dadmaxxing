Maybe I’ll add details later on why they’re so great.</p><h2>Berserk (1997)</h2><p>A big buff dude with a big-ass sword slaying demons. What more could you want? Pretty twisted. I won&rsquo;t say more. Watch the &lsquo;97 anime adaptation.</p><h2>Hajime no Ippo (2000)</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve never been into combat sports, but this has made me consider them. Impossible to not binge during a streak of eps covering a boxing match.</p><h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995)</h2><p>Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve been telling myself I&rsquo;ll re-watch all of eva for the past decade&hellip; Haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it. Part of me is scared I won&rsquo;t enjoy it to the same degree. Embarrassing to admit, but when I was young, I strongly identified with Shinji. I need to convince my wife and son to cosplay Shinji (me), Asuka (wife), and Pen Pen (son).</p><h2>Serial Experiments Lain (1998)</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of early internet culture, existential themes, and/or eerie dreamlike (nightmarish?) atmospheres, this will treat you well. A great psych horror.</p><h2>Trigun (1998)</h2><p>Supremely goofy for the first half of the series. The plot rollout will hook you. Subtly laced political thought that has contemporary relevance.</p><h2>Yu Yu Hakusho (1992)</h2><p>Absolute loveable main cast. Epic villains that almost make you root for them.</p>","tags":["anime"]}]
